<h2>	“What game did you play most recently?” </h2>
<p>Recently I’ve played a good bit of games, but the most recent is 7 Days to Die and Valorant. For those who don’t know “7 Day to Die” is a zombie survival game where every seven days a horde of zombies attacks you and your base. You have to salvage and search for equipment and weapons. Valorant is a FPS 5v5 game where you and your team either defend or attack sites to plant a spike to win each round and first team to 12 rounds won win the game.</p>

<h2>What is your favorite game?</h2>
<p>My favorite game “Sons of the Forest”</p>
<p>“Sons of the Forest is exciting, immersive, and beautiful. It is also extremely scary and absolutely packed with content. These are things you probably expect from a big game, but not a budget Early Access title. Sons of the Forest somehow manages to be all of these things simultaneously, and there is still more to come. [Early Access Score = 90]”</p>

<p>Sons of the Forest is my favorite game and I agree with the review. The game is beautiful and very immersive. Its a hyper realistic survival game in modern time and the building is so smooth that it has me just building for hours. On top of that exploring the island and finding all of its secrets and beauty is just amazing. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun realistic, horror, survival game.</p>
