You might think youve experienced VR, and you might have been pretty impressed. Particularly if youre a gamer, there are some great experiences to be had out there or rather, in there today. But over the next few years, in VR, as in all fields of technology, were going to see things that make what is cutting-edge today look like Space Invaders. And although the games will be amazing, the effects of this transformation will be far broader, touching on our work, education, and social lives. Todays most popular VR applications involve taking total control of a users senses sight and hearing, particularly to create a totally immersive experience that places the user in a fully virtual environment that feels pretty realistic. Climb up something high and look down, and youre likely to get a sense of vertigo. If you see an object moving quickly towards your head, youll feel an urge to duck out of the way. Very soon, VR creators will extend this sensory hijacking to our other faculties for example, touch and smell to deepen that sense of immersion. At the same time, the devices we use to visit these virtual worlds will become cheaper and lighter, removing the friction that can currently be a barrier. I believe extended reality XR a term that covers virtual reality VR, augmented reality AR, and mixed reality MR will be one of the most transformative tech trends of the next five years. It will be enabled and augmented by other tech trends, including super-fast networking, that will let us experience VR as a cloud service just like we currently consume music and movies. And artificial intelligence AI will provide us with more personalized virtual worlds to explore, even giving us realistic virtual characters to share our experiences with.

<p> I think vr is a very interesting idea and cool to envelope into the gaming and tech world. As it brings the tech world into the real world making it a more real experience and allow the user to get sucked deep within the vitual world. This can be good and bad though, as the user may lose track of time and can have a negative effect on mental and physical health. Plus those have been proven to over time take a toll on the user and also cause lack of real social interaction and skills. (making the online world their “real world”). </p>
